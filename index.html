		<p>
		My name is Fletch Fangman and I am a sophomore on the swim team here at Midland. I am originally from Cottonwood, Arizona which is a relatively small 
		town just about smack dab in the middle of the state. And believe it or not, even in one of the hottest states in the country, there 
		have been a few winters where we have gotten snow. Back home, I have a younger brother and a younger sister, as well as 3 of the 
		sweetest dogs you'll ever meet. I have been playing sports for as long as I can remember, my 2 favorite sports are baseball and of course, swimming.
		My whole life, I have never known what I want to do as a career, I have always been very indecisive about it and I have never found something that
		I thought I might enjoy doing for the rest of my life. But, after our first class, I am super excited to learn more about coding because I think
		it's really fun and interesting and I can definitely see myself making a career out of it.
